                                Google is great… for other things. Declassified and Ratified is a niche tool served to taylor search results based on finding information about federal governments. These documents and official data are buried elsewhere. We use google’s cse engine to provide the absolute best searching experience, so it is google in a sense, just a very specific way to search. We hope you enjoy our tool.

                                Declassified and Ratified searches across all federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial government websites. Most government websites end in .gov or .mil, but many end in .com, .org, .edu, or other top-level domains.

Some of our favorite places to share things are reddit and 4chan; however, you can always contact us with something cool. You can even write a little something about it and maybe we will put it as one of D&R’s articles!

                                Declassified and Ratified searches over 10,000 URLs, many of which are news sources. These sources may report on various things, regardless of what their main niche is. The reason for including these sources is to give the user the most primary information available.

                                Declassified and Ratified started out, as many inventions have, with a problem. Browsing the internet one day, I attempted to find an online database of government files to sift through, perhaps procrastinate a couple minutes with. My search was fruitless, and the fact that the U.S. government did not provide a comprehensive database of declassified files astonished me. In fact, I found a link to ancestry.com on an official government website. It was at this point that I, Ethan F., contacted Dylan Modesitt in order to provide a solution to this problem. From this point, and apologies for the cliche, the rest was history. The D&R website you see now was designed and implemented by Dylan Modesitt.

                                The search archives more than 10,000 government affiliated websites and websites providing official government documents to give you the documents you are looking for. At this point, you may be wondering what motivated us to create this website. The answer lies in our philosophy regarding the government. We believe that the government should be as open and willing to share federal documents and information to the public as possible, in order to create more educated voters in America. Both being blind to the faults of the United States and being blind to the good deeds of the United States is wrong. Although we hold our own political views, we are attempting to convince you of no particular political conviction with this website. We only hope that by becoming more informed you can form an educated political stance, whether it be conservative or liberal.
